This blog aims to translate my inner-ramblings into something that hopefully benefits other people working in the field. Some posts will follow my experience with various technologies, some will be sharing experiences from the workplace. What I hope to achieve is sharing my knowledge with others, and offer an insight into what it's like working as a DevOps engineer to those considering such a role.
