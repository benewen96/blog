Hi, thanks for visiting my blog. I'm a 25 year-old Computer Science graduate that started out as a Software Developer. I have since found mysel working heavily in the DevOps and Platform space, predominantly in the Retail sector.

This blog aims to translate my inner-ramblings into something that hopefully benefits other people working in the field. Some posts will follow my experience with various technologies, some will be me ranting after a bad day in the office. What I hope to achieve is sharing my knowledge with others, and offer an insight into what it's like working as a DevOps engineer to those considering such a role.
