Welcome to the first part of a multi-part series on GitLab. 

In my previous post, I spoke about the influence Docker has had in the DevOps community. I also briefly mentioned GitLab as one of the leaders in adopting this technology:

> "...but the most striking example to me is an open-source web-based DevOps toolset called GitLab.
GitLab embraces the idea of containerisation and all the ideas that complement it. It's utterly brilliant for the following reasons:
> * Docker registry for each repository.
> * 'Runners' that run CI/CD build jobs, that can run themselves inside Docker containers.
> * Docker at its core - GitLab can run inside Docker!"

This series will explain GitLab in depth in four parts:

1. What is GitLab? (You are here)
2. Running GitLab in Docker
3. Configuring GitLab for your needs
4. Security in GitLab

So, without further ado;

## What is GitLab?
